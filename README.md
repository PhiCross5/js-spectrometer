# vanilla JS webAudio spectrometer
A bunch of bars change size according to frequency content of a song that's playing.

## "just show me the thing running!"
click it.

## running or changing
- index.html includes everything. Just open it on a reasonably modern browser, pick a file and click play.
- if you want to tweak and play around, you can change the contents of the  "style" tag and edit the "script" tag at the end of the file.
- change the "numBars" variable if you want more or less bars.
